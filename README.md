A simple tool that broadcasts an existing [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser)/Bedrock server over Xbox Live.

This shows up to the authenticated accounts friends in-game as a joinable session and then anyone thats friends with someone who joined through that method will also see the session as joinable ingame.

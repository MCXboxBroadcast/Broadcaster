A simple [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser) extension that broadcasts the server over Xbox Live.

This shows up to the authenticated accounts friends in-game as a joinable session and then anyone thats friends with someone who joined through that method will also see the session as joinable ingame.
